# QPanel for FreePBX
[QPanel] (https://github.com/roramirez/qpanel) is a wonderful Queue statistics dashboard designed by [Rodrigo Ram√≠rez] (https://github.com/roramirez) which can be integrated with asterisk and Freeswith to get realtime Queue stats. I have integrated this module with FreePBX and create a new module through which you can see this QPanel interface on FreePBX GUI.

# Deployment of QPanel for FreePBX
First you have to configure QPanel on your FreePBX server. I have used port 8081 for Qpanel you can choose as per your requirement. You can configure QPanel by following the QPanel doc [here] (https://github.com/roramirez/qpanel).
